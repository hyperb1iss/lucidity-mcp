# Lucidity MCP - Implementation Plan

This checklist outlines the steps to build and deploy Lucidity MCP using Python and the FastMCP SDK.

## Phase 1: Setup and Environment

- [ ] Create GitHub repository (`lucidity-mcp`)
- [ ] Set up Python development environment
- [ ] Install core dependencies:
  - [ ] FastMCP SDK
  - [ ] Testing frameworks (pytest)
  - [ ] Documentation tools
- [ ] Set up project structure following Python best practices
- [ ] Create initial README with project description and setup instructions
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Phase 2: Core Implementation

- [ ] Define server configuration and metadata
  - [ ] Server name, version, description
  - [ ] Capability declarations
- [ ] Implement the core MCP server using FastMCP
  - [ ] Setup basic server skeleton
  - [ ] Configure stdio transport
  - [ ] Implement initialization logic

## Phase 3: Issue Definitions and Prompts

- [ ] Define the comprehensive catalog of code quality issues:
  - [ ] Unnecessary complexity
  - [ ] Poor abstractions
  - [ ] Unintended code deletion
  - [ ] Hallucinated components
  - [ ] Style inconsistencies
  - [ ] Security vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Performance issues
  - [ ] Code duplication
  - [ ] Incomplete error handling
  - [ ] Test coverage gaps
- [ ] For each issue type, define:
  - [ ] Clear name and description
  - [ ] Detailed checkpoints for analysis
  - [ ] Severity classification guidelines
- [ ] Implement prompt generation logic
  - [ ] Base prompt template with instructions and response format
  - [ ] Language-specific adaptations
  - [ ] Original vs. new code comparison handling
  - [ ] Issue-specific prompt sections

## Phase 4: Tool Implementation

- [ ] Implement the `analyze_code_quality` tool
  - [ ] Define input schema (code, original code, language, focus areas)
  - [ ] Implement tool execution handler
  - [ ] Generate structured analysis prompts
  - [ ] Format and return results

## Phase 5: Testing

- [ ] Implement unit tests for all components
  - [ ] Core server functionality
  - [ ] Prompt generation logic
  - [ ] Tool implementation
- [ ] Create integration tests with mock MCP clients
- [ ] Develop a suite of example code samples for testing
  - [ ] Samples demonstrating each issue type
  - [ ] Multi-issue examples
  - [ ] Different programming languages
- [ ] Manual testing with Claude for Desktop
- [ ] Collect and analyze test results
- [ ] Refine implementation based on test findings

## Phase 6: Documentation

- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] Create usage examples for different scenarios
- [ ] Document installation and setup process
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Implement inline code documentation
- [ ] Develop user guide with:
  - [ ] Setup instructions
  - [ ] Integration with different MCP clients
  - [ ] Example usage patterns
  - [ ] Customization options

## Phase 7: Refinement

- [ ] Optimize prompt generation
- [ ] Refine issue definitions based on testing
- [ ] Implement feedback mechanism for issue detection quality
- [ ] Add support for additional languages or language-specific checks
- [ ] Optimize performance for large codebases
- [ ] Implement caching if needed

## Phase 8: Deployment and Distribution

- [ ] Package for PyPI distribution
- [ ] Create deployment documentation
- [ ] Set up versioning strategy
- [ ] Create release notes for initial version
- [ ] Publish to PyPI
- [ ] Set up update mechanism

## Phase 9: Integration Examples

- [ ] Create integration examples with:
  - [ ] Claude for Desktop
  - [ ] VS Code via custom MCP client
  - [ ] CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Document integration patterns

## Phase 10: Community and Support

- [ ] Set up issue templates on GitHub
- [ ] Create contribution guidelines
- [ ] Establish support channels
- [ ] Develop plan for ongoing maintenance
- [ ] Create community engagement strategy

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- [ ] Add customization options for prompts
- [ ] Implement persistent storage for analysis history
- [ ] Create visualization for code quality trends
- [ ] Develop language-specific analysis enhancements
- [ ] Implement project-level analysis capabilities
- [ ] Add multi-file analysis support
- [ ] Create plugin system for custom issue types
